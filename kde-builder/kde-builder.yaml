  # kde-builder sets 2 options which is used in options like make-options or set-env
  # to help manage the number of compile jobs that happen during a build:
  #
  # 1. num-cores, which is just the number of detected CPU cores, and can be passed
  #    to tools like make (needed for parallel build) or ninja (completely optional).
  #
  # 2. num-cores-low-mem, which is set to the largest value that appears safe for
  #    particularly heavyweight projects based on total memory, intended for
  #    projects like qtwebengine.

# ===============================================================================================
# Starting from here, you can add your custom projects and override options for defined projects.
# ===============================================================================================

#  To change options for projects that have already been defined, use an "override" node.
#  Example:
#
#    override qt6-set:
#      branch: dev
#
#  To define a project with some options, use "project" node.
#  Example:
#
#    project some-app:
#      repository: https://github.com/YourUser/YourProject.git
